# Phase 4 Progress Notes - June 7, 2021

## This week's progress
- Last week I set up a remote database using mongodb and used an online tutorial as a framework to set up the CRUD functionality in Node and Express for the TOPICS collection. 
- No frontend work has been done yet, although this week I will be working on setting up react and making the api calls through a user interface rather than postman

## Challenges
- A steep learning curve learning how to make api calls and database connections using node and mongodb, however the grand principles are very similar to what I have done in Asp.net
- Server detects the url entered and type of request, and sends to the proper controller and method. That controller then sends a separate request to the data access layer. This is very similar to the interaction between the MVC and API controllers in Asp.net so at least in that regard having some prior knowledge sped things along
